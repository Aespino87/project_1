                    <p class="about"><img src="http://adamespino.com/img/profile.jpg" alt="Adam" width= 150px>I am Adam Espino and I am a Chicago based Graphic Designer and creative professional with experience in digital media. I began my love of digital media at an early age using programs such as “KID PIX” and “Microsoft Paint” to draw and create. I’ve always had an interest in computers and what they can bring to society. I knew that was something I wanted my future job to involve. As a child, I enjoyed playing video games and working on computers. I thought about a career in the game design field, but quickly realized that programming languages were something I had very little interest in. <br><br>As I began to explore more about my career path, I decided to take a graphic design class in High School. There, I quickly realized that I could use my talents with digital media in another constructive way. I have always been a very sociable person who loves to form connections with people. I found that the graphic design field is the perfect career path to use both my love of digital media and creating connections with people. I believe that a good design can connect with people and can convey a very strong message.</p>
